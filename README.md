# Instrument-Drivers
This is the RSN Instrument Driver project.  The purpose of this project is to provide a uniform architecture and interface
that can be used for testing of instruments in-house and also be used for configuration, control and normal operations of deployed
instruments.  The challenge of this project is to hide as much of the vendor specific differences between all the instruments and 
still provide an interface that can do the basic operations for each individual instrument in a uniform manner.
